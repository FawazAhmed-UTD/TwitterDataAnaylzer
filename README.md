# TwitterDataAnaylzer
In this project we will collect social media data (from Twitter, Instagram,, etc) and analyze them to retrieve any roadside traffic accident related information (like the location of incident, severity, type of injuries, etc). A particular region will be specified to focus on for data collection.
Twitter_Searcher.py is main program
tweets.json and tweets.csv are sample outputs

Old_Twitter_Searcher.py uses tweepy and GetOldTweets3 to get tweets within certain dates, compares them, and stores them in mongoDB or a json file if you choose.

Figure below illustrates the processes/steps done for this project
